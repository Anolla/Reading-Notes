# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

HTML describes the structure of pages, it uses elements to describe the structure of pages, elements are usually made up of two tags : an opening and a closing tag.
Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the infotmation that lies between their opening and closing tag

## Html5 
The point of creating these new elements is so that web pages authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page. (rather than just grouping itmes using div elements )

## JavaScript
It's a language that uses scripts. A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. A browser may use different part of the script, depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
It is used to make add interactivity to your web site.
