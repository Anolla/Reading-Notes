# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## Lists

### HTML provide us with different types of lists:
- ordered lists (numbered items)
- unordered lists (bullet points )
- definition lists ( are made up of a set of itmes along with the definition for each of those items)

*you can create a list by using \<li> inide another \<li> element


## Boxes

- You can set your own dimensions for a box by using height and width properties

* Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance :
- Border: it seperates the edge of one box from another .
- Margins : you csn set the width of a margin to createa gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes
- Padding : the space between the border of the box and any content contained within it , allows you to specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.



## Decisions and Loops
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than oneset of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if    none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
