# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Links

What is a link?

A link is the  feature of the web that allow you to move from one web page to another, enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

There are different types of links: 

* Links from one website to another
* Links from one page to another on the same website
* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
* Links that open in a new browser window
* Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone



## Layout

* \<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
*Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
