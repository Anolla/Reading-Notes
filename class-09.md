# Forms and Events

## Forms

Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a \<form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.


## Events

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
- DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
- You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
- From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
- In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
