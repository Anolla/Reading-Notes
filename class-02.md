# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

- When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the
page. These tags provide extra meaning
and allow browsers to show users the
appropriate structure for the page.

 **Structural markup**: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.(such as: <h1> , <p> , <b> , <sub> , <br /> )

 **Semantic markup**: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on.(such as: <strong> , <em> , <abbr> , <dfn> , <<address>> )
